Preamble

The DAO exists to preserve and govern the standard, ensuring coherence, transparency, and continuity over time. All actions are guided by deliberate principles rather than short-term incentives or external pressures.

1. Purpose
The DAO governs the supply and structural decisions of the standard to ensure stability and long-term integrity. Its role is to preserve, not to promote or speculate.

2. Governance
Decisions regarding issuance, distribution, or changes to the system require explicit approval through the DAO. No unilateral action is permitted.

3. Supply Control
A significant portion of tokens is held by the DAO to prevent discretionary allocation. Supply changes occur only through governed processes.

4. Liquidity
Liquidity exists to support on-chain existence and infrastructure continuity. It is not used as a marketing or speculation tool.

5. Transparency
All balances, governance actions, and structural decisions are observable on-chain. Transparency is a baseline expectation.

6. Participation
Participation is optional. Contributors are neither required to act nor penalized for inactivity. The DAO does not compete for engagement metrics.

7. Change Management
Structural changes are implemented only when necessary. All changes must be documented, justified, and approved through governance.

8. Restraint and Consistency
Restraint in action and decision-making is a deliberate feature. Consistency over time is prioritized over rapid optimization.

9. Longevity
The DAO prioritizes continuity over short-term outcomes. Actions are designed to sustain the standard rather than chase immediate recognition or growth.

10. Philosophy
The DAO does not exist to persuade or convince. Its role is to preserve a standard that does not require belief, only disciplined adherence and thoughtful governance.
